# NoughtsAndCrosses
Used express, node and socket.io to create a 2 player "tic tac toe"/ "noughts and crosses" game

Make sure you have node and express already installed
Once you have CD'd into the document, in terminal type the following: 
`npm i --save socket.io`

After that go on your browser and use localhost:5000
